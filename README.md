# ai4goodTueStudents

This is the structure of last year's assignment.
In the folder '2AMM15-2023-A2-Template' we can find exactly what each student is provided with, a notebook with the shell functions, as well as a 'validation.py' file that we use to grade and evaluate the results quickly.
Outside the folder is the type of solutions we expect 'Assignment_2_Model_Solution_2023.ipynb', which would lead to one of the highest grades.
